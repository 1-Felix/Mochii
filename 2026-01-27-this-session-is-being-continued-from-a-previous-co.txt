● I'm ready and waiting for your update on the Supabase database changes. Once  
  you've added the game_mode and daily_date columns to the leaderboard table,   
  the separate daily and free play leaderboards will be fully functional.       
                                                                                
  The code is already set up to:                                                
  - Filter daily leaderboard by game_mode = 'daily' AND daily_date = [today's   
  date]                                                                         
  - Filter free play leaderboard by game_mode = 'freeplay'                      
  - Submit scores with the appropriate game_mode and daily_date values          
                                                                                
  Let me know when you've completed the database changes or if you run into any 
  issues.
